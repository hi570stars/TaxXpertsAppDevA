If you are here, you are in the right place! :)

About Us: 
We are TaxXperts, meaning we have a mission to educate youth, students, and really anyone who is interested in learning about Taxes. 

Sneha, Danica, and Shriya: Your 3 TaxXperts, are here for you even when it seems like your teachers aren't. 
Being high school seniors and a high school graduate, personally, we learned all about the Manifest Destiny and proving how a shape is a triangle, but never learned anything about taxes at our schools! We want to bring you this app in order to give you the basics your school couldn't give you and help you out with all the resources you might need! Hopefully, you're more equipped with tax knowledge to help in your transition to adulthood than we were, because that's our only goal! 

Always here for you,

the TaxXperts!

On our app, you will find various pages and resources including the following pages: 
- About Us
- Home Page
- Links/Resources
- Survey
- Tax 101
- Beware of Tax Fraud

Challenges Faced:
1) Getting all of the pages to have similar styling/look uniform across the various screens. 
2) Danica wasn't able to get Expo running on her computer, so she couldn't see what the project looked like. Luckily her two other teammates were very supportive and shared what it looked like so she could see how things were going! (She did reach out to C2C - but no solutions were found)
3) Learning to work with a new framework/code + finding time to work when we all have different schedules and like to stay busy ;)
4) ** Insert more here **

Decisions Made:
1) What civic issue to choose (also a challenge faced in a way as there were SO many options)?
2) Who was going to do what + when and how often/what time we would meet together?
3) ** Insert more here **

Future Improvements/Considerations:
1) We believe that with more time, we could get this app looking and running absolutely AMAZING! We would love to see it on the app store so that way our project and leave a positive impact on the lives of those around us.
2) ** Insert more here **


> Why do I have a folder named ".expo" in my project?

The ".expo" folder is created when an Expo project is started using "expo start" command.

> What do the files contain?

- "devices.json": contains information about devices that have recently opened this project. This is used to populate the "Development sessions" list in your development builds.
- "packager-info.json": contains port numbers and process PIDs that are used to serve the application to the mobile device/simulator.
- "settings.json": contains the server configuration that is used to serve the application manifest.

> Should I commit the ".expo" folder?

No, you should not share the ".expo" folder. It does not contain any information that is relevant for other developers working on the project, it is specific to your machine.

Upon project creation, the ".expo" folder is already added to your ".gitignore" file.

Starting the project/getting QR code run: npx expo start
